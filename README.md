- 👋 Hi, I’m @lgeorget, I've been told by GitHub to fill in this README.
- 👀 I’m interested in formal methods, programming languages design, modeling and dataviz, system and network administration...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Haskell (for quite some time actually)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some more exciting Symfony 5 stuff, if something shows up
- 📫 How to reach me: my email is in my profile, social networks I occasionnally do but not reliably
